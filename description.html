<H2>Description</H2>
<P><i>Calculus Labs: Interactive Computing with Mathematica</i> has been the textbook for <i>Calculus with Mathematica Lab</i> at Liberty University
since Fall 2015. It is also useful to students of some advanced math courses, e.g., differential equations and numerical analysis. As a teacher,
I know what my colleagues and I love. So, many cute examples for teaching and learning are included. They are certainly attractive to students, too.
Therefore, I wish this textbook to be a blessing to many students and instructors as well.

<p>This is not just a traditional textbook but also a type of software. It is published in the electronic format of <i>Mathematica</i> notebooks, which
allows students/users to directly run, test, customize, and copy and paste the code in <i>Mathematica</i>.
