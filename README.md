# Calculus Labs: An Interactive Textbook with Mathematica
David Wang

### Description

Calculus Labs: An Interactive Textbook with Mathematica has been the textbook for Calculus with Mathematica Lab at Liberty University since Fall 2015. It is also useful to students of some advanced math courses, e.g., differential equations and numerical analysis. As a teacher, I know what my colleagues and I love. So, many cute examples for teaching and learning are included. They are certainly attractive to students, too. Therefore, I wish this textbook to be a blessing to many students and teachers as well.

This is not just a traditional textbook but also a type of software. A printed version will make it not as useful and valuable as it is in the electronic format of Mathematica notebooks. Students/Readers can directly run, test, customize, and copy and paste the code, and links are helpful because they function like links in web pages.
